            <p class="faq-title">Should I drink cow’s milk, or give my children cow’s milk, to build strong bones?</p>
            <p>Recent meta-analyses and epidemiological studies have found no clear association between milk consumption and reduced risk of bone fractures. <sup>1-3</sup> Bone fracture rates are generally lower in countries that do not consume milk compared with those that do. <sup>4</sup> Calcium, vitamin D, vitamin K, weight-bearing exercise, and some sun exposure are all important for bone health. There are hundreds of dietary sources of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K, so it’s unnecessary to focus on one specific food as being essential for bone health.</p>

            <p class="faq-title">Should I drink cow’s milk, or give my children cow’s milk, to get enough vitamin D?
            </p>
            <p>
                Only trace amounts of Vitamin D are found naturally in cow’s milk—and only in whole milk. Nearly all types of milk—cow’s milk, most soy milks, etc.—are fortified with vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium. While one study found that children who drink non-cow’s milk rather than cow’s milk have lower vitamin D levels, <sup>5</sup> this study did not examine the types or vitamin D levels of non-cow’s milk that children consumed, and it did not consider the rest of the children’s diet. There is no evidence that the vitamin D added to cow’s milk is better absorbed by the body than the vitamin D added to plant-based milks, so the best advice may be to make sure your choice of milk is fortified with vitamin D (most are). In fact, a recent comparison of the nutritional contents of different types of milks found that every plant-based milk widely available on the market, with the exception of rice milk, contains  higher  levels of vitamin D than cow’s milk. <sup>6</sup>

            <p class="faq-title">Shouldn’t my young child drink cow’s milk to get enough fat and calories?</p>
            <p>
                Pediatricians often tell new parents to give their children cow’s milk after the first year of life because it contains high levels of fat and calories, which are both necessary for optimal growth. Children  do  need high amounts of calories, fat, vitamins, and minerals, but these nutrients do not need to come from one type of food. Once a baby is eating solid foods, hundreds of foods can provide these key nutrients. If you are particularly concerned about fat, calcium, and vitamin D or want to offer a beverage that contains these nutrients, plain soy milk is an excellent source of these and other “shortfall” nutrients not provided in cow’s milk (like fiber and iron, for example), <sup>6</sup> and the calcium absorption of soy milk is equal to cow’s milk. <sup>7</sup> Also keep in mind that a licensed pediatrician may be, but is not necessarily, trained in human nutrition; a recent study found that 71 percent of U.S. medical schools fail to provide the recommended minimum of 25 hours of nutrition education to their students, and 36 percent of schools provide less than half that much. <sup>8</sup> Compounding the problem is the influence of the U.S. dairy industry—in particular, the National Dairy Council, which has donated to and partnered with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, among other health groups. <sup>9,10</sup> We aren’t saying your pediatrician and the dairy industry are conspiring against you, but at least consider taking any advice you get about the importance of cow’s milk in human diets with a grain of salt. Or a dash of fortified soy milk.

                Should people with lactose intolerance continue to consume some milk and dairy products?
            </p>
            <p>
                Approximately 61 percent of the global population is lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance is more common among certain populations, affecting up to 100 percent of American Indians and Asians, and up to 80 percent of African Americans, Latinos, and Ashkenazi Jews. (For reference, lactose intolerance affects up to 15 percent of people of Northern European descent). <sup>11,12</sup> Lactose intolerance is not a health concern—it simply occurs when levels of the enzyme lactase decline after we are weaned from breastmilk as children. <sup>13</sup> People who are lactose intolerant typically experience diarrhea, bloating, and/or gas after consuming dairy and may also experience abdominal cramps, nausea, and/or vomiting. The U.S. dairy industry and the American Academy of Pediatrics have encouraged people with lactose intolerance to continue to consume dairy products, <sup>14</sup> but we should wonder why people are being told to consume products that cause negative health symptoms when there are other, nutritionally comparable foods that almost everyone can digest easily.

                Isn’t cow’s milk recommended for everyone?
            </p>
            <p>
                No. For children and adults with inadequate or unhealthy diets, cow’s milk can provide protein and essential nutrients that may otherwise be absent. <sup>4</sup> But for those consume high-quality diets (including green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds), researchers have found that the negative consequences of cow’s milk consumption—which may include increased risk of prostate cancer and unknown consequences of exposure to growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1—may actually outweigh the possible health benefits. <sup>4</sup>

                Are plant-based milks nutritious, and do they taste good?
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost all plant-based milks have added calcium and vitamin D, and many offer nutrients that Americans generally need more of—like fiber and iron—that are not found in cow’s milk. <sup>6</sup> While it is important to read the labels on plant-based milks to ensure your choice provides the nutrients you are looking for, it is also important to get essential nutrients from other foods throughout the day and to exercise regularly. Milk is one of many dietary sources of calcium and vitamin D.</p>
            <p>
                Plant-based milks do not taste identical to cow’s milk, but many people prefer the taste over cow’s milk and there are now several varieties of plant-based milks to choose from (including soy, almond, cashew, flax, hemp, oat, and hazelnut milks). It’s important to give yourself time to adjust to a new flavor and find one you like.

                Does soy milk contain too much estrogen to drink regularly?
            </p>
            <p>
                No. Soy naturally contains isoflavones—compounds that can act as estrogens. But the isoflavones in soy products can also act as antiestrogens, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatories.
                Due to these properties, soy products may actually work to  suppress  cancer growth: observational studies have found that higher consumption of whole soy products is associated with modestly decreased breast cancer risk, and the association is even stronger if whole soy products are consumed in childhood and adolescence. <sup>15</sup> The American Cancer Society recommends against taking soy supplements   due to their high isoflavone concentration, but recognizes moderate consumption (1-2 servings each day) of soy foods   as safe and protective against certain types of cancer. <sup>16</sup>
